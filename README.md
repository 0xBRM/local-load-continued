local-load

Load popular JavaScript libraries from a local resource, rather than over the Web, using valid HTML5 compliant custom data attributes. Currently supports all JavaScript files listed on the Google AJAX Library API.

TODO (for now; more will come):
* Merge some jquery js files;
* Merge some jqueryui js files;
* Probably more of the above.
